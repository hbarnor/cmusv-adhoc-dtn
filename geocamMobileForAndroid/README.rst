About
-----
GeoCam Mobile for Android is, unsurprisingly, the Android portion of the GeoCam
Project.  Currently there only exists this Android-based mobile software to 
support the GeoCam Project.

This software is, essentially, an application to upload geo-tagged, oriented
photos to a server in hopes to aid in disaster management.  It also contains a
GPS track recorder and periodic live position uploading.

See http://geocamshare.org for more details on the GeoCam project.

See the docs_ directory for more information about this code.

The main/master repo for this project is located in the geocam_ organization's
