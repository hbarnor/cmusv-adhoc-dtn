Index
-----
setup_
    You should probably read this first.  This will get your computing system
    setup to do GeoCam Mobile development.

architecture_
    This describes the code base in a general fashion, explaining how the
    pieces fit together and what makes it all tick.

protocol_
    This document describes how the client and the server talk to one another.
    Read this if you want to re-write it completely, while still retaining
    server compatability -- or if you want to write your own, simple dev 
    server.
